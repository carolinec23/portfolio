    textTwo: "I’ve been gaining all my web dev knowledge by self-teaching, navigating my way through tutorials, courses and forums. That’s been nice, however, I feel like it's time to take the next step and gain practical experience in a different environment.",
    textThree: "I'm currently on the hunt for a full-time job (not just a summer internship). I admit: I lack prior commercial experience, but I'd love the opportunity to elevate myself and grow - along with your company."
